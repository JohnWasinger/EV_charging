# EV_charging
A design for an EV car charging station.

Designing VHDL logic for a battery charging station for an electric automobile involves several components and functionalities. Below is a conceptual outline of how you might approach this design, along with some example VHDL code snippets.

### Key Components and Features
1. **Input Signals:**
- `battery_voltage`: Current voltage of the battery.
- `charging_enable`: Signal to enable or disable charging.
- `temperature`: Battery temperature to ensure safety.

2. **Output Signals:**
- `charging_status`: Indicates whether the battery is charging.
- `charge_current`: Controls the current supplied to the battery.
- `fault_indicator`: Indicates any faults in the charging process.

3. **Control Logic:**
- Monitor the battery voltage and temperature.
- Enable charging if the voltage is below a certain threshold and the temperature is within a safe range.
- Implement a state machine to handle different charging states (e.g., charging, finished, fault).

### Example VHDL Code Snippet

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_ARITH.ALL;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL;

entity BatteryCharger is
Port ( battery_voltage : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0);
charging_enable : in STD_LOGIC;
temperature : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
charging_status : out STD_LOGIC;
charge_current : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0);
fault_indicator : out STD_LOGIC);
end BatteryCharger;

architecture Behavioral of BatteryCharger is
signal state : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(1 downto 0);
constant VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(11 downto 0) := "000010100000"; -- Example threshold
constant TEMP_THRESHOLD : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 downto 0) := "00101000"; -- Example threshold for temperature
begin

process(battery_voltage, charging_enable, temperature)
begin
if charging_enable = '1' then
if battery_voltage < VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD and temperature < TEMP_THRESHOLD then
charging_status <= '1'; -- Charging
charge_current <= "00000001"; -- Example current
fault_indicator <= '0'; -- No fault
else
charging_status <= '0'; -- Not charging
charge_current <= (others => '0'); -- Stop current
fault_indicator <= '1'; -- Possible fault condition
end if;
else
charging_status <= '0';
charge_current <= (others => '0');
fault_indicator <= '0'; -- No fault if charging is disabled
end if;
end process;

end Behavioral;
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The entity `BatteryCharger` defines the inputs and outputs.
- Inside the architecture, a process monitors the inputs.
- When `charging_enable` is high, it checks the battery voltage and temperature.
- If the conditions are met, it sets the charging status and current; otherwise, it indicates a fault.

### Next Steps:
1. Refine the logic based on specific requirements (e.g., implementing different charging modes).
2. Add more sophisticated control, such as PID controllers for current regulation.
3. Test the design in a simulation environment to ensure proper behavior.
